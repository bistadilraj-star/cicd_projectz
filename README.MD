# DevOps and Software Delivery

DevOps improves software delivery by:

- **Faster releases:** Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) allow frequent and reliable updates.
- **Better collaboration:** Development and Operations teams share responsibilities, reducing delays and miscommunication.
- **Higher quality:** Automated testing and monitoring catch errors early, ensuring stable applications.
- **Continuous improvement:** Feedback loops help teams iterate quickly and efficiently.
